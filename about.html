    <H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
   <p>Hello, I'm Andy—a passionate and driven aspiring web developer. With a background that spans sales, customer service, and catering, I bring a unique blend of people-focused experience and problem-solving skills to my work. At 29, I've decided to shift my career focus to development, combining my love for technology with a commitment to creating meaningful, user-centered digital experiences.
    <H3>PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND</H3>
    After gaining diverse international experience across Europe and the U.S., I've made the decision to pivot into the field of programming. This shift allows me to combine my passion for problem-solving with my deep interest in technology. Currently, I'm refining my skills in coding and web development through hands-on projects, eager to apply my creativity, adaptability, and previous experience to new challenges in the tech space.
    <H3>PASSIONS AND INTERESTS</H3>
    In my free time, I’m passionate about music and retro games from the 90s and 2000s—interests that influence my approach to design and development. I’ve been a lifelong fan of Nintendo's iconic franchises like Pokémon and Mario, which continue to inspire my creativity. My love for the 90s and 2000s does not limit itself with videogames, as cinema and other media form that era are very dear to me. I love arts: Audio, Video, Visual still imagiry, really any artform speaks to me on some levels. Always eager to learn and grow, I’m excited to contribute to innovative projects and bring fresh ideas to the table.

    <H3>GOALS (HOPES AND DREAMS)</H3>
    In the long term, my goal is to join a dynamic development team where I can continue to learn, grow, and contribute to impactful projects. I’m eager to leverage my diverse background in customer service and problem-solving, alongside my technical expertise, to create intuitive, user-centered products that are both functional and visually compelling.

<br> Let’s connect and build something amazing together!
