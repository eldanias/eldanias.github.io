    <h1>ABOUT ANDY!</h1>
    <H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
   <p>Hi, I'm Andy, a 29-year-old aspiring developer with a diverse background in sales, customer service, and catering. 
    <H3>PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND</H3>
    After working across Europe and the U.S., I've decided to pivot into the world of programming, combining my passion for problem-solving with my love for technology. I’m currently honing my skills in coding and web development through hands-on projects, and I’m excited to apply my creativity and experience in new ways.
    <H3>PASSIONS AND INTERESTS</H3>
    In my free time, I’m an avid fan of music and 90s/2000s retro games—interests that inspire my approach to design and development, and I have been a fan of Nintendo's franchises like Pokemon and Mario Brothers since my very childhood . I'm always looking to grow, learn, and contribute to innovative projects. 
    <H3>GOALS (HOPES AND DREAMS)</H3>
    In the long term, I aspire to join a dynamic development team where I can continue to learn and grow, contributing to meaningful projects that make an impact. Ultimately, I want to combine my diverse background in customer service and problem-solving with my technical expertise to create intuitive, user-centered products that are both functional and visually engaging.
    Let's connect and create something great together!
