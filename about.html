   <p>Hi, I'm Andy, a 29-year-old aspiring developer with a diverse background in sales, customer service, and catering. After working across Europe and the U.S., I've decided to pivot into the world of programming, combining my passion for problem-solving with my love for technology. I’m currently honing my skills in coding and web development through hands-on projects, and I’m excited to apply my creativity and experience in new ways.

    In my free time, I’m an avid fan of music, art, and retro games—interests that inspire my approach to design and development. I'm always looking to grow, learn, and contribute to innovative projects. Let's connect and create something great together! </p>
