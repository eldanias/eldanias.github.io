    <title>THIRD PROJECT</title>
</head>
<body>
    <P>My third project was a more ambitious and complex challenge that pushed me to expand my skills significantly. This project involved both front-end and back-end development, where I applied everything I'd learned so far and then some. I integrated dynamic features, worked with APIs, and utilized JavaScript for interactivity, while also refining my CSS and HTML skills. The real challenge came in managing the project structure and ensuring smooth functionality across all components. It was a great opportunity to learn about full-stack development, debugging, and optimizing performance. Completing this project was a huge milestone in my journey, and it gave me the confidence to tackle even more intricate projects in the future.</P>
