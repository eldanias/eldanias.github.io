    <h2>SECOND PROJECT</h2>
    <P>For my second project, I focused on improving my front-end skills by diving deeper into CSS layout techniques, particularly Flexbox and Bootstrap. This project allowed me to create a responsive and visually appealing design with more complex layouts. I applied what I had learned about positioning, alignment, and grid systems to build a polished user interface. Working with Flexbox and Bootstrap helped me understand how to design flexible and mobile-friendly layouts, and it was a great way to solidify my CSS foundation. It was both a challenging and rewarding experience, and Iâ€™m excited to continue building on these skills.</P>
